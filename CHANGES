1.4.0 2022xxxx
  CR: OpenAPI: Added the missing OpenAPI Specification
  NT: Harmonization of version numbers for the different implementations
      Major and minor describe the API, patch refers to the implementation.
      The version of OpenAPI therefore only uses major and minor, patch is always 0.

      Addressed targets (axes) use status 204 in combination with the response header Storage-Effects.
  BF: Service: Optimization/harmonization of content types for XML
      Fragments (PUT/PATCH) uses text/xhtml
      XML output uses application/xml
      XSLT input (POST) uses application/xslt+xml

  CR: Service: Added directives for XPath
      Directives are added at the end of the XPath separated by exclamation marks (!).
  CR: Service: Added the directive JSON
      This directive transforms the output to JSON.
  CR: Service GET/POST: Added support for accept header: application/json
      The header enforces the transformation of XML and text output as JSON.
      If the return value is not application/xslt+xml or text/plain, the header
      has no effect on the output. The client is informed via the Content-Type
      whether the transformation was used.
