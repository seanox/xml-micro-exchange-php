1.4.0 2025xxxx
BF: Build: Review and optimization
CR: Service: Optimization of the configuration via environment variables
    Simplifies the provision as a container.
    - XMEX_URI_XPATH_DELIMITER: XPath delimiter in the URI (!)
    - XMEX_STORAGE_DIRECTORY: Directory of the data storage (./data)
    - XMEX_STORAGE_QUANTITY: Maximum number of files in data storage (65535)
    - XMEX_STORAGE_SPACE: Maximum data size of files in data storage in bytes (256 *1024)
    - XMEX_STORAGE_EXPIRATION: Maximum idle time of the files in seconds (15 *60)
    - XMEX_STORAGE_REVISION_TYPE: Basis of the revision number (1)
    - XMEX_DEBUG_MODE: Activates debug mode for unit tests (false)
    TODO: Add description in manual
CR: Request: Configurable XPath delimiter of the URI
    XPath delimiter for the URI is not automatically the first symbol.
    The uniform standard is the exclamation mark !
    TODO: Add description in manual + OpenAPI
CR: Request: Omission of XPath via query string
    The XPath includes the query string as part of the path.
CR: Request: Uniform identifier question mark for Base64 and hex encoded paths

CR: Storage: Optimization of the cleanup
    To reduce the execution time of the requests, the cleanup only runs every
    minute. Parallel cleanups due to parallel requests cannot be excluded, but
    should not be a problem.
    TODO: Add description in manual
CR: Storage: Review and optimization
    - The name now allows word characters and minus, if the minus is not at the
      beginning and not at the end.
      TODO: Add description in manual
    - The encoding of the file name has been optimized so that case-sensitive
      also works in case-insensitive file systems (like Windows).
    - Added the consideration of the root element. Name of storage and name of
      root element define the case-sensitive name of the storage in the file
      system. This means that the different spelling of the root element creates
      different storages.
      TODO: Add description in manual
CR: Service: Review of revision management
    - Added option XMEX_STORAGE_REVISION_TYPE
      Defines what the revision which is used in the attributes ___rev and
      ___uid should be based on. With 'serial', an auto incremental integer is
      used. The default value is 'timestamp', which uses an alphanumeric
      timestamp.
      TODO: Add description in manual
    - Omission of the response header Connection-Unique
      The client can manage this better for itself. The created ___uid attribute
      of the elements are now based on the storage revision ___rev attribute.
      TODO: Update description in manual
    - Omission of the response header Storage-Effects
      TODO: Add description in manual
    - Switch to response header Storage-Revision with the number of changes
      schema: revision/number of changes, e.g. Storage-Revision: 123/45
      without changes Storage-Revision: 123/0
      TODO: Add description in manual
CR: Service: Review and optimization of CONNECT
    - Storage must be initialized mandatory with CONNECT before it can be used.
    - Added alternative alias method TOUCH, if CONNECT is not allowed.
    - Added alternative PUT without XPath, if CONNECT and TOUCH is not allowed.
    TODO: Add description in manual + OpenAPI
CR: Service: Review and optimization of OPTIONS
    - Omission of the response header Storage-Effects.
    - Omission as an alternative to CONNECT.
      If CONNECT is not allowed use TOUCH.
      If TOUCH is not allowed use PUT without XPath.
    TODO: Add description in manual + OpenAPI
CR: Service: Review and optimization of GET
    - Requests with an XPath that does not address a target are responded to
      with status 204 (No Content). Previously it was status 404, but 404 now
      refers exclusively to the storage.
    TODO: Add description in manual + OpenAPI
CR: Service: Review and optimization of DELETE, PATCH, PUT
    - Requests with XPath that do not address a target are answered with status
      304 (Not Modified), as the request does not change the storage.
    TODO: Add description in manual + OpenAPI
CR: Service: Optimization of data storage
    - Unnecessary spaces and indentations are removed.
CR: Service: Review and optimization of POST
    - Extension of the element output by the attribute encoding to specify the
      response header Content-Type.
    TODO: Add description in manual + OpenAPI
CR: Test: Added option XMEX_DEBUG_MODE
    - Forces the use of the automatic incremental revision type
    - Adds hashed headers for request, response and storage to the response
    - Storage files are also created with the file extension xml and formatted
    - Storage files are saved in versions
    TODO: Add description in manual
CR: Test: Review and optimization
    - Switch to the use of XMEX_DEBUG_MODE
    - Switch to new hashes in the response header
      Trace-Request-Hash, Trace-Request-Header-Hash, Trace-Request-Data-Hash
      Trace-Response-Hash, Trace-Response-Header-Hash, Trace-Response-Data-Hash
      Trace-Storage-Hash
    TODO: Add description in manual
CR: Docker: Added support as Docker image
    TODO: Add description in manual

1.3.1 20240801
BF: Review: Optimization/Corrections
BF: Build: Optimization / correction of the release info process
CR: Build: Releases are now only available on the release page
CR: OpenAPI: Added the missing OpenAPI Specification
CR: Project: Moved repository to xml-micro-exchange-php
NT: Harmonization of version numbers for the different implementations
    Major and minor describe the API, patch refers to the implementation.
    The version of OpenAPI therefore only uses major and minor, patch is always 0.

1.3.0 20210525
BF: Service: Uniform use of status 204 for 202 / 404
    Status 404 always refers storage and not entities/addressed targets in the storage.
BF: Service: Uniform use of status 204 for 404 in relation to targets in the storage (axes)
    Status 404 is now only used in relation to storage.
    Addressed targets (axes) use status 204 in combination with the response header Storage-Effects.
BF: Service: Optimization/harmonization of content types for XML
    Fragments (PUT/PATCH) uses text/xhtml
    XML output uses application/xml
    XSLT input (POST) uses application/xslt+xml
CR: Service: OPTIONS responds with 204 instead of 200

1.2.0 2021xxxx
NT: Version was skipped
    For compatibility with the JavaScript implementation

1.1.0 20210225
BF: Service: Optimization of CONNECT
    Status 507 (Insufficient Storage) now only occurs when a new storage is
    to be created, but not when connecting to an existing one.
BF: Service: Optimization of CORS
    Correction for a correct preflight OPTIONS response.
    Change to the full notation of the Access-Control headers.
    Omission of the automatic prefix.
BF: Build: Correction of release
    Release file (zip) was not overwritten if already exists.
BF: Service: Uniform use of the GMT time zone
    changes: Storage-Last-Modified / Storage-Expiration
BF: Service: Correction in the creation of trace and trace hashes
BF: Service: Correction of POST for use of status 422 by errors in the stylesheets instead of status 400
    Concerns the declaration from the output
CR: Service: Added directives for XPath
    Directives are added at the end of the XPath separated by exclamation marks (!).
CR: Service: Added the directive JSON
    This directive transforms the output to JSON.
CR: Service GET/POST: Added support for accept header: application/json
    The header enforces the transformation of XML and text output as JSON.
    If the return value is not application/xslt+xml or text/plain, the header
    has no effect on the output. The client is informed via the Content-Type
    whether the transformation was used.
CR: Test: Added Snake as proof of concept for a multiplayer game

1.0.0 20201220
NT: Release is available
