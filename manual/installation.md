# Installation

__This chapter is only relevant if you want to run the Datasource on your own
server. If you want to use an existing Datasource on the Internet, you can skip
this chapter.__

XML-Micro-Exchange consists of only one file. If possible, the script uses its
own directory, but it also works together alongside other scripts.  

XML-Micro-Exchange needs a location for the storages at runtime. By default,
the data-directory is created in the working directory by the script. The
required permissions are set automatically. The file name of the service.php
can be changed as desired.

__For PHP, the extension xsl must be enabled.__
